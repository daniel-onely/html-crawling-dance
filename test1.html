    <h2>Visiting Tunisia - don't need to cancel your flights</h2>

    <p>TUNIS, Tunisia - The blood on this sand has washed away, but the injury inflicted on Tunisia by some terrifying
      minutes of gunfire in a shore resort will be deep and lasting. The tourism business, the lifeline for the north
      African nation's economics, is very likely to be gutted after 38 vacationers were killed in this June 26 rampage
      in Sousse. Up to two million hotel nights are expected to be dropped over the subsequent year, quickened by
      warnings from Britain alongside other European authorities weekly ago their taxpayers are no more safe on
      Tunisia's shores. Tunisia's budding democracy - the just one to emerge in the Arab Spring uprising - is currently
      facing its toughest test.</p>
    <p>A big portion of the government's struggle will be comprising the financial fallout of this tourist exodus, and
      social unrest which may lead to mass job losses in the travel sector. It is not just impacting Us Britons coming
      home back. It's impacting the whole of Tunisia itself, said Scottish tourist Darren Blackery, drinking a beer near
      a pool in the resort of Hammamet and lamenting his government's warning to leave the nation. On Sunday, the last
      British vacationers were leaving - and just 15 clients will stay. At the fourteen days since the beach attack, 1,
      155 people have canceled their bookings.</p>
    <p>Similar stories are told down and up Tunisia's Mediterranean coast, as resort entertainers seek work elsewhere
      and hotel managers ponder whether and once to close down. Policemen guard this entrance of this Bardo museum at
      Tunis, Tunisia, Thursday, March 19, 2015, as a blood stain is seen in right, a day after gunmen opened fire
      killing more than 20 people, mainly vacationers. Twenty 3 hotels have already closed by the Sousse attack, stated
      Radhouane Ben Salah, president of Federico Federation Hotel Federation. Camel guide Faycal Mihoub slammed a
      tourist group to safety throughout this Sousse attack, harboring some at his boss house.</p>
    <p>Enthusiastic about his work and about the vacationers who Called Family, Mihoub knows its <a
        href="test2.html">sandy beach livelihood</a>. Some tourists have been coming for forty Years into this sands of
      this Port El Kantaoui district of Sousse - since even before this 34 year old Mihoub was born. For work, we never
      get anything at Tunisia throughout the winter, he said. In this June 28 2015 file photo, mounted cops patrol on
      the shore of Sousse, Tunisia. Tourism employed about 400, 000 individuals in this nation of 10 million and made up
      about 7 percent of gross domestic product at the year 2014.</p>

    <h2>Modern Ballroom Dancing</h2>
    <p>Dancing has played a huge role in the cultures of several societies. A lot of the history of ballroom dance has
      entailed social gatherings, dances and balls, where dancing was particularly significant as a way of allowing
      young people in fulfill each other, with the expectation that they may fulfill their future husband or wife.
      Ballroom dancing allowed couples to spend some time in close proximity, while chaperoned. Throughout the Middle
      Ages, there was hardly any gap between folk and ballroom dance, and dance frequently involved groups of people
      moving in circles and lines, rather than dancing as couples. This was in part because most chambers needed a
      central hearth, around which the dancers needed to proceed. </p>
    <p>Once chimneys and fireplaces located on the side of the room started to be utilized, the motion of the dancers
      was no longer limited by the obstruction of the hearth. Social dancing began to different from folk dance across
      the Renaissance, with much more formalized dances becoming common in the European royal courts. France was the
      origin of a lot of the new styles of dance currently. The Minuet appeared throughout the seventeenth century, in
      the end of the formal, mannered period. The waltz was mostly enabled by the warmer surfaces of dance flooring at
      that the time, and by that the abandonment of heavy hobnailed shoes. </p>
    <p>Possibly the most crucial characteristics of the waltz was the individual couples started to move separately,
      that became very important in today's ballroom dancing of the twentieth century. Throughout the twentieth century,
      several new dances were introduced into the ballroom. The Tango was derived from two dances, a solo dancing from
      Spain and an Argentine courtship dance which was initially considered taboo among polite society in Argentina. A
      moderated version of that the tango had emerged prior to the World War I. Dances like that the American foxtrot,
      quickstep, Afro Cuban rumba, Spanish paso doble, Brazilian samba, Cuban cha, jive and <a href="page-5.html">American swing</a> also became
      well-known throughout the twentieth century, as new music styles and social rules changed and relaxed. </p>
    <p>Modern ballroom dancing originated throughout the twentieth century, with dances the allowed couples to move
      separately and with that the introduction of new music styles. In the same time, there was a growing interest in
      creating dances which could easily be taught from that the new styles of dancing and music, in both that the US
      and Europe. Ballroom dances were becoming standardized, allowing dancer to learn a series of standard motions that
      they may use with any partner they met. Dancers and professionals such as Irene and Vernon Castle, and dancing
      societies like that the Arthur Murray group were very influential. Later in the century, screen stars like Fred
      Astaire helped to spread interest in ballroom dance. Competitive ballroom dancing or dancesport started to
      overtake social dancing at the end of the twentieth century, with two major styles evolving: that the
      International or WDC defined fashion and the American style.</p>

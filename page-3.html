    <h2>Ballet Dance</h2>
    <p>Dance is more than merely a sport, its a passion. Dance is something you work for, something you place time and
      all your effort to. Dance is a sport which you never wish to give up on. You put and show it all into the
      countless people when the day of your dance contest arrives. Irrespective of how exhausted you're on that dance
      floor, you might not give up. You need to dance till the very end, until you're the very best dancer you can
      possibly be. So as to be you need to practice at home in your time.</p>
    <p>Ensure your dance costume looks like the rest of your teams the only way to receive in a
      <a href="page-4.html">dance contest</a> is to exercise all the time, and do like you've never performed before.
      The part of dance is your contests, where you perform your dance in front. Before you are able to do, you need to
      ensure your hair, make-up, and costume looks perfect. It's time to exercise your dancing before you go out on the 
      floor once your dance costume is prepared. Everybody gets in a row of files and head towards the stage your schools team is up next. </p>
    <p>Once you are there, all the dancers hookup and wait. All of them wait until the announcers announce dancing is
      the C. F.Bomber Dance Team! When your schools dancers thats head out on the floor's middle. The pressure is on
      you. When the music begins is whenever you need to start your dance. The audience provides a standing ovation to
      my team and me as the music ends. Everybody stands up and walks excitedly back into their group rooms and waiting
      anxiously until it is time for the Ceremony prize. As soon like most of that the dancers are called down to that
      the gym for that the Ceremony prize, all the dancers from cities most of over Minnesota race down to that the gym
      to see which teams were sufficiently good to be in the top 3 best teams. </p>
    <p>All of the dance teams anxiously wait around to get that the announcer to add up that the scores to get every
      dance team. Lastly he's ready to declare the winning teams. He stands up and says to the mic school which came in
      second place is. The Bombers! Excited cries abruptly fill the stage. Every dancer from my school is jumping,
      screaming, and hugging one another. We got second place at the first contest of the year 2013. All of that the
      Dance Team is as excited as they'd be if they won a lot of cash at a competition.</p>

    <h2>Lambada Dance</h2>
    <p>Zouk is a fun, modern dance appropriate for all ages. For many from the dance audience that was younger, an
      interest in partner dancing has rekindled. For other conventional dances being danced by those who have
      experience, a lot of the moves, techniques or theories from these dances could be imported making it simple to
      adapt to the dance. Zouk is a type of music and both a dance. This sensual and filled with energy dance has roots
      in Samba and Lambada, whilst the music has French roots. Characteristic Movements of Zouk Dance - Zouk includes a
      wave like motion, elongated hair moves that were striking and measures. </p>
    <p>The motions are a side to side and a rippling wave like movement forwards and rear. While hip grinds are
      reminiscent of the Lambada body rolls are reminiscent of the Samba. Accomplished dancers roll their mind and also
      from side to side keeping to their music's rhythm, and developing a quality to their dance. They projecting back
      of the mind and punctuate the end of a step or sequence blueprint with an arch. This is <a href="page-11.html">spectacular to watch</a> and
      is the heart of the Lambada! - The adopt when dancing Zouk Lambada is close. The follower dances on their balls of
      her feet with a twisting motion in order that her measures appear to grind the floor. </p>
    <p>This in turn which highlights her hip movements. Dance Embrace \/ Hold - Zouk can be danced in open or close
      embrace or hold. The open embrace is much like the Salsa open embrace dance hold. The close embrace hold is
      comparable to a Bachata hold. The choice of hold depends upon their comfort level of both partners and their kind
      of audio and dance patterns being used. Open holds are appropriate when dancing with a stranger and once dance a
      fast paced Zouk using underarm turns along with other patterns that require an open adopt. Close embrace holds are
      appropriate for partners who know each other, who're comfortable using the hold and for slower Zouklove or Zouk
      Lambada audio. Men should never assume that females are mechanically comfortable with a close hold. When dancing
      with someone for the very first time, their leader should ask their follower if they're comfortable dancing in
      close embrace. Dance Space - Samba de Gafieira is a spot dancing that's danced in an elongated slot.</p>

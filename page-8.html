    <h2>Samba Dance</h2>
    <p>All eyes are on Brazil and its vibrant culture, with the FIFA World Cup now into its 3rd week and Rio de Janeiro
      set to host the 2016 Olympics. But while football is undoubtedly Brazil's most popular sport, its national rhythm
      is samba. When she walks shes like a samba - That swings so cool and sways so sweet - That whenever she passes,
      every one she passes - Goes Ahhhhh. The Girl from Ipanema, Stan Getz and Joo Gilberto, 1964 - Samba is a genre
      that encompasses a wide array of dance and music styles with complex lineage. When samba spread south to urban
      centers in the late nineteenth century, other forms of the dance started to emerge. </p>
    <p>First, there's the samba of the carnaval parades. The samba in this context is danced individually as a part of a
      very large group, and is conducted to complex percussion music played by a large marching band. Carnaval is, as
      London based arts author Ian Driver writes: partly a modern manifestation of middle ages Christian festivals that
      marked the advent of Lent with subversive and anti authoritarian festivities and partly a descendant of the
      African coronation traditions. Originally, African Brazilian people used the Christian event as a way to practice
      government repressed facets of their culture including their dance and music. </p>
    <p>The original carnaval groups first appeared in approximately 1917 in Rio de Janeiro, and the first government
      sanctioned, and re named, escola de samba was founded in 1928. In the 30s and 40s carnaval samba was harnessed for
      nationalist political purposes under Getlio Vargas rule, promoting celebration of the <a href="page-9.html">African heritage</a> in Brazils
      mixed race culture. The Rio de Janeiro samba schools now participating in annual competitions in a purpose built
      venue that was first utilized in the year 1984. The sambodromo is a road like structure flanked by seating on both
      sides, with a capacity of 90, 000 people. </p>
    <p>Whilst the celebrations in Rio de Janeiro are perhaps the most well known outside of Brazil, carnaval is
      celebrated all over Brazil, usually in February. With regards to the music, samba involves a syncopation that
      creates a sense of suspension, and this, as described by American cultural critic Barbara Browning: leaves the
      body with a hunger that may only be satisfied by filling the silence with motion. As can be seen below, whilst the
      dancers Brenda Carvalho and Anderson Mendez da Rocha don't step on count four, the hips continue to move and for
      that reason fill that count. </p>
    <p>The following is one version of the footwork for samba no p, which is samba danced individually. There are
      various versions of the footwork. Here it's shown with a back accent, and not travelling. The hips fall on the
      side of the functioning leg, which is achieved by calming the corresponding knee. In the 30s another type of samba
      emerged in Rio de Janeiro and became a popular social dance in the 40s samba de gafieira, frequently referred to
      as simply samba.</p>
